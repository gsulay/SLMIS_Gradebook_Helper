# SLMIS Gradebook Helper

A desktop application built with **Python**, **PyQt6**, and **Selenium** designed to automate the process of retrieving class schedules, generating grading templates, and uploading grades to the SLMIS (Student Lifecycle Management and Information System) portal.

## 📋 Features

* **GUI Interface:** User-friendly interface built with PyQt6 for easy navigation.
* **Secure Login:** Automates the login process to the SLMIS Oracle PeopleSoft portal.
* **Schedule Retrieval:** Automatically fetches and lists the faculty member's teaching schedule/sections.
* **Template Generation:** Downloads the current gradebook from the web, cleans the data, and generates a formatted Excel (`.xlsx`) template for offline grading.
* **Automated Grading:** Reads grades from your local Excel file and automatically inputs them into the SLMIS web interface, handling pagination and data entry fields.
* **Data Validation:** Handles name formatting (removing delimiters) and matches student data between the local file and the web portal.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Python 3.8+**
2. **Google Chrome Browser** (The automation uses the Chrome WebDriver).
3. **Visual C++ Redistributable** (Required for some Python UI libraries).

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gsulay/SLMIS_Gradebook_Helper.git
cd <your-repo-folder>

```


2. **Install Dependencies**
It is recommended to use a virtual environment. Install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install PyQt6 pandas selenium tqdm openpyxl

```



## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Launch the Application

Run the main script to start the application:

```bash
python main.py

```

*(Note: Cache files will take time building on your first use. Please wait for approximately **2 mins**).*

### 2. Login

* A login dialog will appear. Enter your SLMIS credentials.
* Upon success, the automated browser will launch (do not close this window) and the main dashboard will open.

### 3. Generate a Grading Template

1. Select a **Section/Subject** from the list on the left sidebar.
2. Click the **Generate Template** button.
3. The tool will navigate the website, export the class list, and save a cleaned Excel file named `[Section_Name].xlsx` in your project directory.

### 4. Input Grades

* Open the generated Excel file.
* Input the grades into the appropriate columns.
* **Save** the Excel file.

### 5. Upload Grades

1. Back in the application, make sure the correct section is still selected.
2. Click **Load Grades** and select your saved Excel file.
3. Verify the data in the preview table.
4. Click **Grade**.
5. The application will iterate through the students on the webpage and input the grades.
* *Watch the browser window to ensure accuracy, but do not interfere with the mouse/keyboard while it works.*



### 6. Finalize

* Once the popup says "Grading completed," verify the grades on the web browser.
* Manually click the **Save** button on the SLMIS webpage to commit the changes.

## ⚠️ Important Notes & Troubleshooting

* **Browser Control:** This tool uses Selenium to control a Chrome browser. **Do not minimize or close the controlled browser window** while operations are running.
* **Internet Connection:** Ensure a stable internet connection. If the connection drops or the page takes too long to load (timeout > 10s), the operation may fail.
* **CSV/Excel Formatting:** The tool includes specific logic to handle names containing commas (e.g., "Doe, Jr., John"). If template generation fails, ensure the source data on SLMIS doesn't have unusual character encoding.
* **"Stale Element" Errors:** If the script stops due to a "Stale Element Reference," it usually means the webpage refreshed unexpectedly. Simply try running the action again.

## ⚖️ Disclaimer

This tool is for educational and productivity purposes. Please ensure you verify all grades entered into the system before hitting the final "Save" button on the portal. The developers are not responsible for incorrect grade entries resulting from unverified automation.
